// CASTING
// Rust provides no implicit conversiion but explicit conversion can be used using as

// INFERENCING
// The type inferencing system looks at the value as well as how the variable is used in the code to infer the type.


#![allow(overflowing_literals)]

// ALIASING
// the type statement can be used to give a new name to an existing type
// the main use of aliasing is avoiding boilerplate, e.g. the IoResult<T> type is an alias for the Result<T, IoError> type
type u64_t = u64;

    // when casting any value to an unsigned type T, std::T::MAX + 1 is added or subtracted till the value fits into the new type
    // mostly, this means that don't cast like an idiot!

    // have to use `as` with a variable binding - numeric literals can be annotated by using suffixes
    // if a literal is unsuffixed, the type depends on how it's used.
