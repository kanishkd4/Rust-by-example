// Closures in rust, also called lambda expressions are functions that can capture the enclosing environment
// they are good for on the fly usage. Calling a closure is like calling a function
// Howver, both input and return types can be inferred and the input variable names must be provided

// use || instead of () around input variables.
// {} is optional for single expressions, mandatory otherwise.

fn main() {
    // incremement via functions and closures
    fn function(i: i32) -> i32 { i + 1 } 

    let closure_annotated = |i: i32| -> i32 { i + 1 };
    let closure_inferred = |i| i + 1;

    // a closure can take no arguments and return a value
    let one = || 1;
    println!("Closure returning One: {}", one());

    // CAPTURING
    // closures can capture and move variables without annotation and flexibly adapt to the use case
    use std::mem;
    let color = "green";
    let print = || println!("`color`: {}", color); // the closure borrows color and stores the borrow and the closure
    // in the print variable - it will remain borrowed till print goes out of scope. println! only requires `by reference`
    print();
    print();

    let mut count = 0; // a closure to increment count can take either `&mut count` or `count` but `&mut count` is less restrictive
    // so it takes that
    let mut inc = || { // a mut is required on inc because a `&mut` is stored inside. Calling the closure mutates it
        count += 1;

    // let reborrow = &mut count; // this will give an error as count is already borrowed as a mutable inside the closure

        println!("`movable`: {:?}", movable);
        mem::drop(movable);

// AS INPUT PARAMETERS - seems to be more advanced. Will probably have to revisit a few times
// Function input parameters always have to be annotated.
// If a closure is used as an input parameter, the closure's complete type must be annotated using only a few traits
// Fn: &T; FnMut: &mut T; FnOnce: T (this is in order of decreasing restriction)
// if we use FnOnce, it can be either of the 3 based on how the captured varaibles are used in the closure
// This is because if a move is possible, any type of borrow should be possible. If a mutable borrow is possible,
// then an immutable borrow should also be possible
fn apply<F>(f: F) where
    F: FnOnce() {
        f(); // the closure takes no input and returns nothing
    }

// a function that takes a closure and returns an i32
fn apply_to_3<F>(f: F) -> i32 where 
    F: Fn(i32) -> i32 {
        f(3)
    }

// TYPE ANONYMITY
// https://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/05/finding-closure-in-rust/

// INPUT FUNCITONS - functions can also take other functions as parameters.
// if we define a function that takes a closure as a parameter, any function that satisfies the trait bound can be passed as a parameter
fn call_me<F: Fn()>(f: F) { // function that takes a generic `F` argument bounded by Fn() and calls it.
    f();}

fn function1() {
    println!("I am a function");
}

// OUTPUT PARAMETERS - a function can return a closure but rust only supports returing concrete types. 
// Returning a closure is only possible by making it concrete. This can be done via boxing
