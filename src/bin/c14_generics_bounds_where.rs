// When working with generics, the type parameters often must use traits as bounds to stipulate what functionality
// a type implements, e.g. one example here uses the traitl Display to print so it requires T to be 
// bound by Display; that is, T must implement Display

use std::fmt::Display;

fn printer<T: Display>(t: T) {
    println!("{}", t);
}

// Bounding restricts the generic to types that conform to the bounds. That is :
struct s<T: Display>(T); // S can only be a type that implements the Display trait - so no vectors

// Another effect of bounding is that generic instances are allowed to access the methods of traits 
// specified in the bounds
use std::fmt::Debug; // a trait that implements print marker {:?}

    fn area(&self) -> f64;

// The generic T must implement Debug. Regardless of the type, this will work properly
fn print_debug<T: Debug>(t: &T) {

// T must implement HasArea. Any function which meets the bound can access HasArea's function area

// WHERE CLAUSES
// A bound can also be expressed using a where clause immediately before the opening {, rather than at the type's first mention
// where clauses can apply bounds to arbitrary types, rather than to type parameters.

// A where clause is useful when specifying generic types and bounds separately is clearer
